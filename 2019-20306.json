{"abstract":"PHMSA is revising the Federal Pipeline Safety Regulations to improve the safety of onshore gas transmission pipelines. This final rule addresses congressional mandates, National Transportation Safety Board recommendations, and responds to public input. The amendments in this final rule address integrity management requirements and other requirements, and they focus on the actions an operator must take to reconfirm the maximum allowable operating pressure of previously untested natural gas transmission pipelines and pipelines lacking certain material or operational records, the periodic assessment of pipelines in populated areas not designated as \"high consequence areas,\" the reporting of exceedances of maximum allowable operating pressure, the consideration of seismicity as a risk factor in integrity management, safety features on in-line inspection launchers and receivers, a 6-month grace period for 7-calendar-year integrity management reassessment intervals, and related recordkeeping provisions.","action":"Final rule.","agencies":[{"raw_name":"DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION","name":"Transportation Department","id":492,"url":"https://www.federalregister.gov/agencies/transportation-department","json_url":"https://www.federalregister.gov/api/v1/agencies/492","parent_id":null,"slug":"transportation-department"},{"raw_name":"Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration","name":"Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration","id":408,"url":"https://www.federalregister.gov/agencies/pipeline-and-hazardous-materials-safety-administration","json_url":"https://www.federalregister.gov/api/v1/agencies/408","parent_id":492,"slug":"pipeline-and-hazardous-materials-safety-administration"}],"body_html_url":"https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/full_text/html/2019/10/01/2019-20306.html","cfr_references":[{"chapter":null,"citation_url":null,"part":191,"title":49},{"chapter":null,"citation_url":null,"part":192,"title":49}],"citation":"84 FR 52180","comment_url":null,"comments_close_on":null,"correction_of":null,"corrections":[],"dates":"The effective date of this final rule is July 1, 2020.
